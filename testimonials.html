                        Hingeder and we're planning to get married next year! We clicked from the first day
                        we met, which is a testament to how amazing the Hingeder matching algorithm is."

                        to set expectations. People seem to either want to hook up or get married, there's 
                        no in between. However, with Hingeder, you are always matched with someone that is 
                        your speed which makes it easier to want to get to know someone. I've enjoyed my time 
                        with Hingeder so far and will continue to use it because I know I will find the perfect 
                        match!"

                        success with online dating platforms, especially as a woman in her 30s. But I
                        decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. I met my boyfriend on Hingeder
                        and we've been together for over a year now. I'm so happy I decided to give it
                        a try. It's not just for young people and hookups like some other dating platforms.
                        It's also not just for divorcees and widows. It's for everyone!"
