        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Hingeder is a match making company that uses a unique algorithm to match people based on their interests and hobbies.
            We also have dating experts available for counseling and general dating advice.
            Here at Hingeder, we pride ourselves on being a business
            founded by a few friends who just wanted to make it easier for everyone to meet new people. 
            What started as a class project has turned into a full fledged business that we are
            passionate about continuing to build and improve. 

            We have been in business for over 5 years now and have helped thousands
            of people find their soulmates.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2>What sets us apart?</h2>
            <p>   
            Our state of the art matching algorithm is guaranteed to help you find someone that
            you will love. We have a team of experts that are constantly working to improve our
            algorithm based on not only the statistics that we get back from our yearly analysis, 
            but also from the feedback that we get directly from our users. Because of this, we 
            are always open to feedback and suggestions from our users. Our matching algorithms was
            created for our users, so they should have a say in how it works. There is no other
            matching service that matches our level of dedication to our users.
            
            We also know that it can be scary to give out your personal information. That is why in 
            addition to our matching service, we offer appointments with our professional dating 
            consultants to help you find our more about our product and what we can do for you. We 
            also offer a variety of safety tips to help you stay safe while using our product. 

            We hope you enjoy using Hingeder as much as we enjoyed building it!      
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>When we first came up with the idea of creating a dating consultant business, we thought 
            what will distinguish our business from the others? We decided that the best way for us 
            to stand out was to create a matching service that felt genuine and authentic. 
            We are a small business that is passionate about what we do, not a large corporation that
            is only interested in making money. At our core, we are a group of friends who want to help
            people find love. We took aspects from our own experiences talking to 
            our friends about dating and put them into our matching algorithm. We hope that you will feel a sense 
            of comfort and trust when you use our service like you do with a close friend.
        </p>

                            Joshua “jkimchi” Kim is the CFO and one of the co-founders of Hingeder. As a college 
                            student, he got absolutely 0 play, so he and co-founders created a website to make it
                            easier for him to find love. While this was ultimately unsuccessful for him, his efforts 
                            have made it possible for Hingeder to be the successful dating platform it is today.
